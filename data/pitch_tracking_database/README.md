The plan here is to store pickles of the features of the pitch tracking database to make it easier to train / test different classifiers against each other 
the whole dataset will be saved as it is - will have a look at one of the speakers first to make sure the VAD is working as expected.
will also contain the norm factors - experiment with this later - might be quicker to normalize them now ?
