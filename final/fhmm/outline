deliverables:

// un-mixing
[1] show correct states identified in gaussian noise
[2] show un-mixing in state of added real noise
[3] show un-mixing of two humpback whale calls

// noise-handling
[1] create fhmm object which can be combined with a normal hmm
    this might require mergin or removing states in the fhmm which are similar to noise states, kl-divergence ?

    fhmm object
    input = hmm_whale, hmm_noise
    self.viterbi-parallel,
